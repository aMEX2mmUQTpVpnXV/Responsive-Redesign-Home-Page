        <div class="main-text">
          In order to begin redesigning a website we must first find a website
          to redesign! Websites that have issues regarding usability and
          accessibility are usually the best candidates.
          <br />
          <br />
          The website we will be redesigning for this demo is
          <a href="https://www.lancasterpuppies.com/">Lancaster Puppies Shop</a
          >.
          <br />
          <br />
          The redesigned website can be found by clicking the following:
          <a href="https://amex2mmuqtpvpnxv.github.io/Responsive-Redesign"
            >Redesigned Puppy Shop</a
          >.
        </div>
        <div class="main-header">Usability Issues</div>
        <div class="main-text">
          Some issues this website faces regarding usability are:
          <br />
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              The website does not have a minimalistâ€™s design. The interface is
              quite cluttered and it is difficult to immediately tell what is
              happening on the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              There are symbols in the images that are unexplained / unclear.
            </li>
            <li>
              Boxes with rounded edges seem to indicate a web element that is
              clickable but this is not always true.
            </li>
            <li>
              Inconsistent image sizing leads to text that is not lined up in a
              uniform manner. Makes the website harder to parse.
            </li>
            <li>
              On mobile it is not clear that the icons are buttons and since
              there is no text, their function is completely unclear.
            </li>
            <li>
              In the sort by menu it is unclear as to what metric is being used
              currently.
            </li>
            <li>Gratuitous text ex: Puppies for sale in Lebanon , PA</li>
            <li>
              When you use price filter it reloads and resizes, preventing you
              from loosening the restriction.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="main-header">Accessibility Issues</div>
        <div class="main-text">
          The website has a lot of contrast issues. A lot of the text is in a
          light blue color and it does not contrast with the primarily white
          background enough to make the text easy to read. Other parts of the
          website have the same issue but with light gray text. The website also
          has some empty links and links that lead to non functioning or
          nonexistent webpages.
        </div>
        <div class="row-container">
          <div class="prototype-container">

            <div class="main-text">
              Note some prototype annotations are ommited because they are
              practically the same as one of their counterparts (Namely the web
              and tablet versions).
