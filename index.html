    <div class="main-header">Choosing a Website</div>
    <div class="main-text">
      In order to begin redesigning a website we must first find a website to
      redesign! Websites that have issues regarding usability and accessibility
      are usually the best candidates.
      <br />
      <br />
      The website we will be redesigning for this demo is
      <a href="https://www.lancasterpuppies.com/">Lancaster Puppies Shop</a>.

    <div class="main-text">
      Some issues this website faces regarding usability are:
      <br />
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>
          The website does not have a minimalistâ€™s design. The interface is
          quite cluttered and it is difficult to immediately tell what is
          happening on the page.
        </li>
        <li>There are symbols in the images that are unexplained / unclear.</li>
        <li>
          Boxes with rounded edges seem to indicate a web element that is
          clickable but this is not always true.
        </li>
        <li>
          Inconsistent image sizing leads to text that is not lined up in a
          uniform manner. Makes the website harder to parse.
        </li>
        <li>
          On mobile it is not clear that the icons are buttons and since there
          is no text, their function is completely unclear.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the sort by menu it is unclear as to what metric is being used
          currently.
        </li>
        <li>Gratuitous text ex: Puppies for sale in Lebanon , PA</li>
        <li>
          When you use price filter it reloads and resizes, preventing you from
          loosening the restriction.
        </li>
      </ul>
